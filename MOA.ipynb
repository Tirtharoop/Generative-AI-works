You are capable of segmenting a given code snippet based on the following conditions: 1. Identify and group methods that have similar functionality into clusters. This should be done by analyzing the code and identifying common functionality, such as input parameters, output parameters, and method calls. 2. Separate different functionality into separate clusters. This can be done by identifying code blocks that are not related to any of the existing clusters and grouping them together. 3. Cluster header files together based on their dependencies. This can be done by analyzing the header files and identifying which files are required by other files. 4. Isolate the main method for individual examination. This can be done by identifying the main method and separating it from the rest of the code. The tool should be capable of handling code snippets of varying sizes and complexity, and should provide accurate and reliable results. It should also be able to handle different programming languages and platforms. The ultimate goal of this tool is to provide a more efficient and effective way of analyzing code, which can help developers identify potential issues and improve the overall quality of their code.\"+codes\n",

            "### Overview:\n",
            "This report offers a comprehensive analysis of the provided Java code snippet, emphasizing semantic segmentation, complexity, and code quality. The code defines a class, 'MathOperations', which facilitates basic arithmetic operations, encompassing addition and multiplication.\n",
            "\n",
            "### Semantic Segmentation:\n",
            "- **Method Clustering:** The code incorporates three methods associated with addition: 'add(int, int)' and 'add(int, int, int)'. These methods are grouped together based on their shared functionality and similar input/output parameters. The 'multiply(int, int)' method constitutes a distinct cluster, indicating a separate functionality.\n",
            "- **Non-Clustered Code:** The code block responsible for user interaction, including input collection and result display, is not assigned to any specific cluster. It acts as an intermediary between the clustered methods and user interface.\n",
            "- **Header File Clustering:** Given the absence of external dependencies, header file clustering is not applicable in this scenario.\n",
            "- **Main Method Isolation:** The 'main(String[] args)' method, serving as the program's entry point, is identified and separated for individual examination.\n",
            "\n",
            "### Complexity Analysis:\n",
            "- **Lines of Code:** The code snippet comprises 38 lines, inclusive of comments and blank lines.\n",
            "- **Number of Methods:** The 'MathOperations' class contains four methods: two variations of 'add', one 'multiply', and the 'main' method.\n",
            "- **Average Method Length:** Each method spans approximately 8.5 lines of code, indicating a reasonable level of complexity.\n",
            "- **Cyclomatic Complexity:** Exhibiting a low cyclomatic complexity of 1, the code suggests a linear control flow without intricate branching.\n",
            "\n",
            "### Code Analysis:\n",
            "- The code demonstrates a clear structure, adhering to standard Java syntax and conventions.\n",
            "- Recursion is not employed in this code snippet.\n",

            "### Overview:\n",
            "This report offers a comprehensive analysis of the provided Java code snippet, emphasizing semantic segmentation, complexity, and code quality. The code defines a class, 'MathOperations', which facilitates basic arithmetic operations, encompassing addition and multiplication.\n",
            "\n",
            "### Semantic Segmentation:\n",
            "- **Method Clustering:** The code incorporates three methods associated with addition: 'add(int, int)' and 'add(int, int, int)'. These methods are grouped together based on their shared functionality and similar input/output parameters. The 'multiply(int, int)' method constitutes a distinct cluster, indicating a separate functionality.\n",
            "- **Non-Clustered Code:** The code block responsible for user interaction, including input collection and result display, is not assigned to any specific cluster. It acts as an intermediary between the clustered methods and user interface.\n",
            "- **Header File Clustering:** Given the absence of external dependencies, header file clustering is not applicable in this scenario.\n",
            "- **Main Method Isolation:** The 'main(String[] args)' method, serving as the program's entry point, is identified and separated for individual examination.\n",
            "\n",
            "### Complexity Analysis:\n",
            "- **Lines of Code:** The code snippet comprises 38 lines, inclusive of comments and blank lines.\n",
            "- **Number of Methods:** The 'MathOperations' class contains four methods: two variations of 'add', one 'multiply', and the 'main' method.\n",
            "- **Average Method Length:** Each method spans approximately 8.5 lines of code, indicating a reasonable level of complexity.\n",
            "- **Cyclomatic Complexity:** Exhibiting a low cyclomatic complexity of 1, the code suggests a linear control flow without intricate branching.\n",
            "\n",
            "### Code Analysis:\n",
            "- The code demonstrates a clear structure, adhering to standard Java syntax and conventions.\n",
            "- Recursion is not employed in this code snippet.\n",

            "### Overview:\n",
            "This report offers a thorough analysis of the provided Java code snippet, emphasizing semantic segmentation, complexity, and code quality. The code defines a class, 'MathOperations', designed to execute basic arithmetic operations, specifically addition and multiplication.\n",
            "\n",
            "### Semantic Segmentation:\n",
            "- **Method Clustering:** The code exhibits a clear clustering of methods based on functionality. There are two distinct clusters: the addition cluster, comprising 'add(int, int)', 'add(int, int, int)', and another overloaded version of 'add(int, int, int)'; and the multiplication cluster, consisting of 'multiply(int, int)'. These methods are grouped according to their shared arithmetic operation.\n",
            "- **Non-Clustered Code:** The portion of the code responsible for user interaction, including input collection and output display, is not assigned to any specific cluster. It serves as an intermediary layer, connecting the clustered methods with the user interface.\n",
            "- **Header File Clustering:** Given that the code does not rely on external libraries or classes, header file clustering is not applicable in this context.\n",
            "- **Main Method Isolation:** The 'main(String[] args)' method, serving as the entry point of the program, is identified and analyzed separately.\n",
            "\n",
            "### Complexity Analysis:\n",
            "- **Lines of Code:** The code snippet consists of 38 lines, including comments and blank lines, indicating a concise implementation.\n",
            "- **Number of Methods:** Within the 'MathOperations' class, there are four distinct methods: two variations of 'add', one 'multiply', and the 'main' method.\n",
            "- **Average Method Length:** Each method spans approximately 8.5 lines of code, suggesting a reasonable level of complexity that balances readability and functionality.\n",
            "- **Cyclomatic Complexity:** Exhibiting a low cyclomatic complexity of 1, the code suggests a linear control flow without intricate branching. This simplicity contributes to the code's understandability.\n",
            "- **Time Complexity:**\n",
            "  - 'add(int, int)' and 'multiply(int, int)': O(1) - These methods have constant time complexity as they perform single arithmetic operations.\n",
            "  - 'add(int, int, int)': O(1) - Similarly, this method exhibits constant time complexity due to a single arithmetic operation.\n",
            "- **Space Complexity:** O(1) - The methods have a constant space complexity as they do not utilize additional data structures that scale with the input size.\n",
            "\n",
            "### Code Analysis:\n",
            "- **Structure:** The code demonstrates a clear structure, adhering to standard Java syntax and conventions, making it readable and maintainable.\n",

            "\n",
            "### 1. Overview\n",
            "This report provides a comprehensive analysis of the Java code snippet \"MathOperations.java,\" focusing on its structure, functionality, complexity, and potential areas for improvement. The code defines a class named `MathOperations` that encapsulates basic mathematical operations, including addition and multiplication. \n",
            "\n",
            "### 2. Code Functionality\n",
            "The `MathOperations` class offers three primary methods:\n",
            "- **`add(int a, int b)`:** This method calculates the sum of two integers (`a` and `b`) and returns the result.\n",
            "- **`multiply(int a, int b)`:** This method calculates the product of two integers (`a` and `b`) and returns the result.\n",
            "- **`add(int a, int b, int c)`:** This is an overloaded version of the `add` method, which calculates the sum of three integers (`a`, `b`, and `c`) and returns the result.\n",
            "\n",
            "The `main` method serves as the entry point for the program. It prompts the user to enter three numbers, creates an instance of the `MathOperations` class, calls the appropriate `add` and `multiply` methods to perform the calculations, and then displays the results.\n",
            "\n",
            "### 3. Code Structure\n",
            "The code adheres to a clear class-based structure, embodying good object-oriented programming principles:\n",
            "- **Encapsulation:** Data (the input numbers) and methods (the mathematical operations) are bundled together within the `MathOperations` class, promoting data hiding and modularity. This means the internal workings of the class are hidden from the outside world, and users only interact with the class through its defined methods.\n",
            "- **Abstraction:** The user interacts with the class through its methods, without needing to know the internal implementation details of how the calculations are performed. This abstraction simplifies the code and makes it easier to understand and maintain.\n",
            "\n",
            "### 4. Complexity Analysis\n",
            "The code exhibits a low complexity profile:\n",
            "- **Time Complexity:**\n",
            "   - `add` and `multiply` methods: O(1) - Constant time complexity. The execution time remains constant regardless of the input size.\n",
            "   - `main` method: O(1) - Constant time complexity as the number of operations is fixed.\n",
            "- **Space Complexity:**\n",
            "   - `add`, `multiply`, and `main` methods: O(1) - Constant space complexity. The memory usage remains constant regardless of the input size.\n",

            "- **Input Validation:** The code lacks input validation to handle invalid user input, such as non-numeric values or invalid data types. Implementing input checks would enhance the program's robustness and user experience.\n",
            "- **Error Handling:** The code does not include error handling mechanisms to manage exceptions, such as `ArithmeticException` for invalid operations. Adding error handling would make the code more robust and prevent unexpected crashes.\n",
            "- **Descriptive Variable Names:** While the variable names are understandable, using more descriptive names (e.g., `firstNumber`, `secondNumber`) could further improve code readability and maintainability.\n",
            "- **Expanded Functionality:** The code could be extended by adding more arithmetic operations (e.g., subtraction, division, modulo) to provide a more comprehensive set of functionalities.\n",
            "- **Documentation:** The code could benefit from more comprehensive documentation, such as Javadoc comments, to explain the purpose and usage of the class, methods, and variables. This would make the code more understandable and maintainable for other developers.\n",

            "### 8. Conclusion\n",
            "The \"MathOperations.java\" code demonstrates a good understanding of basic mathematical operations and object-oriented programming principles. However, incorporating input validation, error handling, more descriptive variable names, expanded functionality, and comprehensive documentation would significantly enhance its robustness, usability, and maintainability.\n"

            "### Overview:\n",
            "This report offers a thorough analysis of the provided Java code snippet, emphasizing semantic segmentation, complexity, and code quality. The code defines a class, 'MathOperations', designed to execute basic arithmetic operations, specifically addition and multiplication.\n",
            "\n",
            "### Semantic Segmentation:\n",
            "- **Method Clustering:** The code exhibits a clear clustering of methods based on functionality. There are two distinct clusters: the addition cluster, comprising 'add(int, int)', 'add(int, int, int)', and another overloaded version of 'add(int, int, int)'; and the multiplication cluster, consisting of 'multiply(int, int)'. These methods are grouped according to their shared arithmetic operation.\n",
            "- **Non-Clustered Code:** The portion of the code responsible for user interaction, including input collection and output display, is not assigned to any specific cluster. It serves as an intermediary layer, connecting the clustered methods with the user interface.\n",
            "- **Header File Clustering:** Given that the code does not rely on external libraries or classes, header file clustering is not applicable in this context.\n",
            "- **Main Method Isolation:** The 'main(String[] args)' method, serving as the entry point of the program, is identified and analyzed separately.\n",
            "\n",
            "### Complexity Analysis:\n",
            "- **Lines of Code:** The code snippet consists of 38 lines, including comments and blank lines, indicating a concise implementation.\n",
            "- **Number of Methods:** Within the 'MathOperations' class, there are four distinct methods: two variations of 'add', one 'multiply', and the 'main' method.\n",
            "- **Average Method Length:** Each method spans approximately 8.5 lines of code, suggesting a reasonable level of complexity that balances readability and functionality.\n",
            "- **Cyclomatic Complexity:** Exhibiting a low cyclomatic complexity of 1, the code suggests a linear control flow without intricate branching. This simplicity contributes to the code's understandability.\n",
            "- **Time Complexity:**\n",
            "  - 'add(int, int)' and 'multiply(int, int)': O(1) - These methods have constant time complexity as they perform single arithmetic operations.\n",
            "  - 'add(int, int, int)': O(1) - Similarly, this method exhibits constant time complexity due to a single arithmetic operation.\n",
            "- **Space Complexity:** O(1) - The methods have a constant space complexity as they do not utilize additional data structures that scale with the input size.\n",
            "\n",
            "### Code Analysis:\n",
            "- **Structure:** The code demonstrates a clear structure, adhering to standard Java syntax and conventions, making it readable and maintainable.\n",
            "- **Recursion:** Recursion is not employed in this code snippet, keeping the implementation straightforward.\n",
            "- **Naming Conventions:** Class and method names conform to Java naming conventions, enhancing readability and consistency.\n",
